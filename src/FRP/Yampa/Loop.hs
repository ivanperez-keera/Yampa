-- Domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming hybrid (mixed
-- discrete-time and continuous-time) systems. Yampa is based on the concepts
-- of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and is structured using arrow
-- combinators.
--
-- You can find examples, tutorials and documentation on Yampa here:
--
-- <www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Yampa>
--
-- Structuring a hybrid system in Yampa is done based on two main concepts:
--
-- * Signal Functions: 'SF'. Yampa is based on the concept of Signal Functions,
-- which are functions from a typed input signal to a typed output signal.
-- Conceptually, signals are functions from Time to Value, where time are the
-- real numbers and, computationally, a very dense approximation (Double) is
-- used.
--
-- * Events: 'Event'. Values that may or may not occur (and would probably
-- occur rarely). It is often used for incoming network messages, mouse
-- clicks, etc. Events are used as values carried by signals.
--
-- A complete Yampa system is defined as one Signal Function from some
-- type @a@ to a type @b@. The execution of this signal transformer
-- with specific input can be accomplished by means of two functions:
-- 'reactimate' (which needs an initialization action,
-- an input sensing action and an actuation/consumer action and executes
-- until explicitly stopped), and 'react' (which executes only one cycle).
-- 
-- Apart from using normal functions and arrow syntax to define 'SF's, you
-- can also use several combinators. See [<#g:4>] for basic signals combinators,
-- [<#g:11>] for ways of switching from one signal transformation to another,
-- and [<#g:16>] for ways of transforming Event-carrying signals into continuous
-- signals, [<#g:19>] for ways of delaying signals, and [<#g:21>] for ways to
-- feed a signal back to the same signal transformer.
--
-- Ways to define Event-carrying signals are given in [<#g:7>], and
-- "FRP.Yampa.Event" defines events and event-manipulation functions.
--
-- Finally, see [<#g:26>] for sources of randomness (useful in games).
--
-- CHANGELOG:
--
-- * Adds (most) documentation.
--
-- * New version using GADTs.
--
-- ToDo:
--
-- * Specialize def. of repeatedly. Could have an impact on invaders.
--
-- * New defs for accs using SFAcc
--
-- * Make sure opt worked: e.g.
--
--   >     repeatedly >>> count >>> arr (fmap sqr)
--
-- * Introduce SFAccHld.
--
-- * See if possible to unify AccHld wity Acc??? They are so close.
--
-- * Introduce SScan. BUT KEEP IN MIND: Most if not all opts would
--   have been possible without GADTs???
--
-- * Look into pairs. At least pairing of SScan ought to be interesting.
--
-- * Would be nice if we could get rid of first & second with impunity
--   thanks to Id optimizations. That's a clear win, with or without
--   an explicit pair combinator.
--
-- * delayEventCat is a bit complicated ...
--
--
-- Random ideas:
--
-- * What if one used rules to optimize
--   - (arr :: SF a ()) to (constant ())
--   - (arr :: SF a a) to identity
--   But inspection of invader source code seem to indicate that
--   these are not very common cases at all.
--
-- * It would be nice if it was possible to come up with opt. rules
--   that are invariant of how signal function expressions are
--   parenthesized. Right now, we have e.g.
--       arr f >>> (constant c >>> sf)
--   being optimized to
--       cpAuxA1 f (cpAuxC1 c sf)
--   whereas it clearly should be possible to optimize to just
--       cpAuxC1 c sf
--   What if we didn't use SF' but
--      SFComp :: <tfun> -> SF' a b -> SF' b c -> SF' a c
--   ???
--
-- * The transition function would still be optimized in (pretty much)
--   the current way, but it would still be possible to look "inside"
--   composed signal functions for lost optimization opts.
--   Seems to me this could be done without too much extra effort/no dupl.
--   work.
--   E.g. new cpAux, the general case:
--
-- @
--      cpAux sf1 sf2 = SFComp tf sf1 sf2
--          where
--              tf dt a = (cpAux sf1' sf2', c)
--                  where
--                      (sf1', b) = (sfTF' sf1) dt a
--                      (sf2', c) = (sfTF' sf2) dt b
-- @
--
-- * The ONLY change was changing the constructor from SF' to SFComp and
--   adding sf1 and sf2 to the constructor app.!
--
-- * An optimized case:
--     cpAuxC1 b sf1 sf2               = SFComp tf sf1 sf2
--   So cpAuxC1 gets an extra arg, and we change the constructor.
--   But how to exploit without writing 1000s of rules???
--   Maybe define predicates on SFComp to see if the first or second
--   sf are "interesting", and if so, make "reassociate" and make a
--   recursive call? E.g. we're in the arr case, and the first sf is another
--   arr, so we'd like to combine the two.
--
-- * It would also be intersting, then, to know when to STOP playing this
--   game, due to the overhead involved.
--
-- * Why don't we have a "SWITCH" constructor that indicates that the
--   structure will change, and thus that it is worthwile to keep
--   looking for opt. opportunities, whereas a plain "SF'" would
--   indicate that things NEVER are going to change, and thus we can just
--   as well give up?
