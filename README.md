[![Flattr this](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png "Flattr This!")](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=ivanperez-keera&url=https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa&title=Yampa&language=&tags=github&category=software)

Domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming hybrid (mixed
discrete-time and continuous-time) systems. Yampa is based on the concepts of
Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and is structured using arrow
combinators.

## Installation

Yampa is available on hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa.

```
$ cabal sandbox init         # Optional, but recommended
$ cabal update
$ cabal install Yampa
```

## Examples

Getting Yampa to run is trivial. FRP is about values that change over time. In
Yampa, a system is defined by a signal function (SF), which determines how the
varying input and the varying output relate. For example:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}
import FRP.Yampa

signalFunction :: SF Double Double
signalFunction = proc x -> do
  y <- integral -< x
  t <- time     -< ()
  returnA -< y / t
```

This signal function says that the output signal is the integral `y` of the
input signal `x`, divided by the time `t`. The above syntax uses a Haskell
extension called Arrows. If you are unhappy using arrow syntax, you can also
write that code using applicative style and/or arrow combinators:

```haskell
signalFunction1 :: SF Double Double
signalFunction1 = (/) <$> integral <*> time

signalFunction2 :: SF Double Double
signalFunction2 = (integral &&& time) >>^ (/)
```

All three are equivalent, and it's a matter of which one you like best. To run
this example, we need to provide the inputs, the times, and consume the output:
```haskell
firstSample :: IO Double   -- sample at time zero
firstSample =
  return 1.0  -- time == 0, input == 1.0

nextSamples :: Bool -> IO (Double, Maybe Double)
nextSamples _ =
  return (0.1, Just 1.0) -- time delta == 0.1s, input == 1.0

output :: Bool -> Double -> IO Bool
output _ x = do
  print x     -- print the output
  return False -- just continue forever
```

This is a trivial example, since the integral of the constant function 1.0 over
time, divided by the time, is always 1.0! Nevertheless, we are now ready to
run!

```
ghci> reactimate firstSample nextSamples output signalFunction
1.0
1.0
1.0
1.0
1.0
1.0
...
```

There is a directory with examples, which includes two basic SDL examples and
one with using a Nintendo Wii Remote. You can install them with:

```
$ cabal sandbox init         # Optional, but recommended
$ cabal update
$ cabal install Yampa -fexamples
```

There are many programs written in Yampa:

* [Haskanoid](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid): a game that uses
  SDL multimedia, wiimote and kinect. It's cross platform and works in desktop,
  mobile, and [web](http://ivanperez-keera.github.io/haskanoid/haskanoid.jsexe/index.html)
  (compiled with [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs)).
* [Space invaders](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SpaceInvaders).
* [Frag](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/frag): a 3D first person shooting game.
* [Peoplemon](https://linearity.itch.io/peoplemon): a role playing game.
* [Yampa-2048](https://github.com/ksaveljev/yampa-2048): an implementation of
  the game 2048 using Yampa and Gloss.
* [MandelbrotYampa](https://github.com/madjestic/Haskell-OpenGL-Tutorial/tree/master/MandelbrotYampa):
  a "hello world" using SDL2, Yampa and OpenGL.
* [Haskelloids](https://github.com/keera-studios/Haskelloids): a reproduction of the Atari 1979 classic "Asteroids"

A more comprehensive list can be obtained using the reverse dependency finder
(http://packdeps.haskellers.com/reverse/Yampa), but only programs uploaded to
hackage are listed.

## Use in production

* Keera Studios is using it for several Haskell games for Android and iOS
  including a game currently available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magic-cookies/id1244709871) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.keera.games.magiccookies). See:

  * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.keera.games.magiccookies

## Backends

Yampa is backend agnostic, you can ultimately connect it to any backend you
want. Existing backends include:
* SDL
* SDL2
* OpenGL / GLUT
* WX (see wxHaskell)
* HTML Canvas via JS Dom (for an example, see [haskanoid's GHCJS branch](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid/blob/ghcjs/src/Display.hs))
* HTML5 Canvas via blank-canvas (see [yampa-canvas](https://github.com/ku-fpg/yampa-canvas))
* Gloss (see [yampa-gloss](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa-gloss))
* Diagrams (see [diagrams example](examples/Diagrams.hs))
* [Keera Hails](https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails/tree/master/keera-hails-reactive-yampa) (reactive programming framework with GTK, WX, Qt, Android, iOS and HTML support).

## Testing

Yampa comes with a sophisticated testing library that allows you to use
QuickCheck to test your games, and use a time-travel debugger. These features
are described in the paper [Testing and Debugging Functional Reactive
Programming](http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N46564).

You can find the additional projects at:
* [yampa-test](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/tree/develop/extensions/testing)
* [Haskell Titan](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-titan)

## Documentation and tutorials

The distribution of Yampa comes with substantial haddock documentation, which you can
build using haddock or just [read online](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa).
To build a local copy, do:

```
$ cabal unpack Yampa ## Or git clone this-repo
$ cd Yampa-*
$ cabal init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal configure && cabal haddock --internal
```

Documentation is also available online: https://wiki.haskell.org/Yampa

## Help and collaboration

You can collaborate at least in three ways:

* File an issue (https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/issues).
* Write documentation (send a link and/or a pull request).
* Research: we are constantly trying to improve Yampa. We'd be glad to have
  collaborators.  If you are working on this, please, let us know.

  (_Interactivity and FRP is the main topic of my (ongoing) work and research,
   so I'll keep working on this for some time._ -- Ivan Perez)
