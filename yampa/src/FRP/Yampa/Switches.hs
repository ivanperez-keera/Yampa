--
-- Switches allow you to change the signal function being applied.
--
-- The basic idea of switching is formed by combining a subordinate signal
-- function and a signal function continuation parameterised over some initial
-- data.
--
-- For example, the most basic switch has the following signature:
--
-- @switch :: SF a (b, Event c) -> (c -> SF a b) -> SF a b@
--
-- which indicates that it has two parameters: a signal function
-- that produces an output and indicates, with an event, when it is time to
-- switch, and a signal function that starts with the residual data left by the
-- first SF in the event and continues onwards.
--
-- Switching occurs, at most, once. If you want something to switch repeatedly,
-- in general, you need to loop, or to switch onto the same signal function
-- again. However, some switches, explained below, are immediate (meaning that
-- the second SF is started at the time of switching). If you use the same SF
-- that originally provoked the switch, you are very likely to fall into an
-- infinite loop. In those cases, the use of 'dSwitch' or '-->' may help.
--
-- Switches vary depending on a number of criteria:
--
-- - /Decoupled/ vs normal switching /(d)/: when an SF is being applied and a
-- different SF needs to be applied next, one question is which one is used
-- for the time in which the switching takes place. In decoupled switching, the
-- old SF is used for the time of switching, and the one SF is only used after
-- that. In normal or instantaneous or coupled switching, the old SF is
-- discarded immediately and a new SF is used for the output already from that
-- point in time.
--
-- - How the switching event is provided /( \/r\/k)/: normally, an 'Event' is
-- used to indicate that a switching must take place. This event can be part of
-- the argument SF (e.g., 'switch'), it can be part of the input (e.g.,
-- 'rSwitch'), or it can be determined by a second argument SF (e.g,
-- 'kSwitch').
--
-- - How many SFs are being handled /( \/p\/par)/: some combinators deal with
-- only one SF, others handle collections, either in the form of a
--'Functor' or a list ('[]').
--
-- - How the input is router /(B\/Z\/ )/: when multiple SFs are being combined,
-- a decision needs to be made about how the input is passed to the internal
-- SFs.  In some cases, broadcasting is used to pass the same input to all
-- internal SFs. In others, the input is itself a collection, and each element
-- is passed to one internal SF (i.e., /zipping/). In others, an auxiliary
-- function is used to decide how to route specific inputs to specific SFs in
-- the collection.
--
-- These gives a number of different combinations, some of which make no sense,
-- and also helps determine the expected behaviour of a combinator by looking
-- at its name. For example, 'drpSwitchB' is the decoupled (/d/), recurrent
-- (/r/), parallel (/p/) switch with broadcasting (/B/).

--
-- Important note: at the time of switching, the second signal function is
