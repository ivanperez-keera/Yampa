-- * Wave-form generation

-- | Zero-order hold.
--
-- Converts a discrete-time signal into a continuous-time signal, by holding
-- the last value until it changes in the input signal. The given parameter
-- may be used for time zero, and until the first event occurs in the input
-- signal, so hold is always well-initialized.
--
-- >>> embed (hold 1) (deltaEncode 0.1 [NoEvent, NoEvent, Event 2, NoEvent, Event 3, NoEvent])
-- [1,1,2,2,3,3]
hold :: a -> SF (Event a) a
hold a_init = epPrim f () a_init
  where
    f _ a = ((), a, a)

-- | Zero-order hold with a delay.
--
-- Converts a discrete-time signal into a continuous-time signal, by holding
-- the last value until it changes in the input signal. The given parameter is
-- used for time zero (until the first event occurs in the input signal), so
-- 'dHold' shifts the discrete input by an infinitesimal delay.
--
-- >>> embed (dHold 1) (deltaEncode 0.1 [NoEvent, NoEvent, Event 2, NoEvent, Event 3, NoEvent])
-- [1,1,1,2,2,3]
dHold :: a -> SF (Event a) a
dHold a0 = hold a0 >>> iPre a0

-- | Tracks input signal when available, holding the last value when the input
-- is 'Nothing'.
--
-- This behaves similarly to 'hold', but there is a conceptual difference, as
-- it takes a signal of input @Maybe a@ (for some @a@) and not @Event@.
--
-- >>> embed (trackAndHold 1) (deltaEncode 0.1 [Nothing, Nothing, Just 2, Nothing, Just 3, Nothing])
-- [1,1,2,2,3,3]
trackAndHold :: a -> SF (Maybe a) a
trackAndHold a_init = arr (maybe NoEvent Event) >>> hold a_init

-- | Tracks input signal when available, holding the last value when the input
-- is 'Nothing', with a delay.
--
-- This behaves similarly to 'hold', but there is a conceptual difference, as
-- it takes a signal of input @Maybe a@ (for some @a@) and not @Event@.

-- * Accumulators

-- | Given an initial value in an accumulator,
--   it returns a signal function that processes
--   an event carrying transformation functions.
--   Every time an 'Event' is received, the function
--   inside it is applied to the accumulator,
--   whose new value is outputted in an 'Event'.

                                    -- output if no event
      where
        a' = g a

--   until an event arrives).

accumHold a_init = epPrim f a_init a_init
  where
    f a g = (a', a', a') -- Accumulator, output if Event, output if no event
      where
        a' = g a

-- | Zero-order hold accumulator with delayed initialization (always produces
-- the last outputted value until an event arrives, but the very initial output
-- is always the given accumulator).

dAccumHold a_init = accumHold a_init >>> iPre a_init

accumHoldBy g b_init = epPrim f b_init b_init
  where
    f b a = (b', b', b')
      where
        b' = g b a

-- | Zero-order hold accumulator parameterized by the accumulation function
--   with delayed initialization (initial output sample is always the
--   given accumulator).
dAccumHoldBy :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> SF (Event a) b
dAccumHoldBy f a_init = accumHoldBy f a_init >>> iPre a_init

-- | Accumulator parameterized by the accumulator function with filtering,
--   possibly discarding some of the input events based on whether the second
--   component of the result of applying the accumulation function is
--   'Nothing' or 'Just' x for some x.
