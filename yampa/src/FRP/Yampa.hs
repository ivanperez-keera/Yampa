-- Domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming deterministic
-- hybrid (mixed discrete-time and continuous-time) systems. Yampa is based on
-- the concepts of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).
--
-- Yampa has been used to write professional Haskell cross-platform games for
-- iOS, Android, desktop and web. There is a library for testing Yampa
-- applications that allows you to use Temporal Logic and QuickCheck to test
-- your games. You can also use a time-travel debugger to connect to your
-- application running live and debug it step by step.

--
-- __Yampa at a glance__
--
-- A Yampa network is structured as a Signal Function: a pure transformation
-- from a time-varying input to that produces a time-varying output. The Yampa
-- language provides signal function primitives, as well as SF combinators.
-- Primitives and combinators guarantee that SFs are well-formed and efficient.
--
-- For example, a game could take the changing mouse position (continuous-time
-- signal) and mouse clicks (discrete-time signal), combine them as part of
-- some game logic, and produce an animation with sound (continuously changing
-- picture).
--
-- /Signal and SF separation/
--
-- To create a Yampa system, you need to think about three things:
--
-- * How to obtain the input signals coming into your system. This typically
-- requires polling some input device or consuming a queue of input events.
--
-- * How to consume the output signals produced by your system. This typically
-- requires taking output samples or chunks and rendering them or playing them.
--
-- * How to transform the input signal into the output signal. This requires
-- thinking about the transformation applied as time progresses towards the
-- future, possibly switching from one transformation to another as the program
-- evolves.
--
-- The first two aspects lie outside Yampa, and they determine the backends
-- that your system uses. Yampa is backend-agnostic, and you can connect it to
-- SDL, SDL2, OpenGL, Gloss, Diagrams, HTML5 Canvas. In addition, you can use
-- it with any input device you want, and it has been used with Nintendo
-- wiimotes, Microsoft Kinects and LeapMotions.
--
-- The last aspect is what defines Yampa as a language. You define a pure
-- Signal Function (@SF@) using primitives and combinators. You can find a
-- series of primitive SFs in "FRP.Yampa.Basic". For example, the function
-- 'constant' allows you to ignore the input signal and produce a constant
-- output, the function 'arr' allows you to apply a pure function to every
-- input value at every time, ignoring previous history. Signal Functions can
-- transform signals taking their history into account. For example, the
-- function 'integral' integrates the input signal.
--
-- /Execution/
--
-- The execution of this signal transformer with specific input can be
-- accomplished by means of two functions: 'reactimate' (which needs an
-- initialization action, an input sensing action and an actuation/consumer
-- action and executes until explicitly stopped), and 'react' (which executes
-- only one cycle). You can also use the function 'embed' to try your signal
-- functions with lists of input samples in GHCi.
--
-- For a simple example of an SDL application that creates a moving picture
-- around the mouse position, see:
--
-- https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/blob/develop/yampa/examples/yampa-game/MainCircleMouse.hs
--
-- /Hybrid systems/
--
-- Signals can change in continuous or in discrete time (known as 'Event's).
-- Events represent values that may or may not occur (and would probably occur
-- rarely). It is often used for incoming network messages, mouse clicks, etc.
-- Events are used as values carried by signals.  The module "FRP.Yampa.Event"
-- allows you to manipulate events, the module "FRP.Yampa.EventS" deals with
-- event signal functions, and the "FRP.Yampa.Hybrid" allows you to go from a
-- continuous-time domain to a discrete domain, and vice-versa.
--
-- /Vector Spaces/
--
-- Yampa uses vector spaces in time-aware primitives like 'integral'. However,
-- Yampa does not enforce the use of a particular vector space implementation,
-- meaning you could use 'integral' for example with other vector types like
-- V2, V1, etc. from the library linear. For an example, see
-- <https://gist.github.com/walseb/1e0a0ca98aaa9469ab5da04e24f482c2 this gist>.

-- ToDo:
--
-- - Specialize def. of repeatedly. Could have an impact on invaders.
--
-- - New defs for accs using SFAcc
--
-- - Make sure opt worked: e.g.
--
-- - >     repeatedly >>> count >>> arr (fmap sqr)
--
-- - Introduce SFAccHld.
--
-- - See if possible to unify AccHld wity Acc??? They are so close.
--
-- - Introduce SScan. BUT KEEP IN MIND: Most if not all opts would
-- - have been possible without GADTs???
--
-- - Look into pairs. At least pairing of SScan ought to be interesting.
--
-- - Would be nice if we could get rid of first & second with impunity
-- - thanks to Id optimizations. That's a clear win, with or without
-- - an explicit pair combinator.
--
-- - delayEventCat is a bit complicated ...
--
--
-- Random ideas:
--
-- - What if one used rules to optimize
--   - (arr :: SF a ()) to (constant ())
--   - (arr :: SF a a) to identity
--   But inspection of invader source code seem to indicate that
--   these are not very common cases at all.
--
-- - It would be nice if it was possible to come up with opt. rules
--   that are invariant of how signal function expressions are
--   parenthesized. Right now, we have e.g.
--       arr f >>> (constant c >>> sf)
--   being optimized to
--       cpAuxA1 f (cpAuxC1 c sf)
--   whereas it clearly should be possible to optimize to just
--       cpAuxC1 c sf
--   What if we didn't use SF' but
--      SFComp :: <tfun> -> SF' a b -> SF' b c -> SF' a c
--   ???
--
-- - The transition function would still be optimized in (pretty much)
--   the current way, but it would still be possible to look "inside"
--   composed signal functions for lost optimization opts.
--   Seems to me this could be done without too much extra effort/no dupl.
--   work.
--   E.g. new cpAux, the general case:
--
-- @
--      cpAux sf1 sf2 = SFComp tf sf1 sf2
--          where
--              tf dt a = (cpAux sf1' sf2', c)
--                  where
--                      (sf1', b) = (sfTF' sf1) dt a
--                      (sf2', c) = (sfTF' sf2) dt b
-- @
--
-- - The ONLY change was changing the constructor from SF' to SFComp and
--   adding sf1 and sf2 to the constructor app.!
--
-- - An optimized case:
--     cpAuxC1 b sf1 sf2               = SFComp tf sf1 sf2
--   So cpAuxC1 gets an extra arg, and we change the constructor.
--   But how to exploit without writing 1000s of rules???
--   Maybe define predicates on SFComp to see if the first or second
--   sf are "interesting", and if so, make "reassociate" and make a
--   recursive call? E.g. we're in the arr case, and the first sf is another
--   arr, so we'd like to combine the two.
--
-- - It would also be intersting, then, to know when to STOP playing this
--   game, due to the overhead involved.
--
-- - Why don't we have a "SWITCH" constructor that indicates that the
--   structure will change, and thus that it is worthwile to keep
--   looking for opt. opportunities, whereas a plain "SF'" would
--   indicate that things NEVER are going to change, and thus we can just
--   as well give up?
