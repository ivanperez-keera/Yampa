[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/ivanperez-keera/Yampa)
[![Version on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/Yampa.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa)

Domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming hybrid (mixed
discrete-time and continuous-time) systems. Yampa is based on the concepts of
Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

# Installation
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Pre-requisites
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

To use Yampa, you must have a Haskell compiler installed (GHC). We currently
support all versions of GHC from 7.6.3 to modern versions (9.X series as of
this writing).

On Debian/Ubuntu, the Haskell toolchain can be installed with:

```sh
$ apt-get install ghc cabal-install
```

On Mac, they can be installed with:

```sh
$ brew install ghc cabal-install
```

## Compilation
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

Once you have a working set of Haskell tools installed, install Yampa from
[hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa) by executing:

```sh
$ cabal update
$ cabal install --lib Yampa
```

Running the following will print the word `Success` if installation has gone
well, or show an error message otherwise:

```
$ runhaskell <<< 'import FRP.Yampa; main = putStrLn "Success"'
```

# Examples
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

Getting Yampa to run is trivial. FRP is about values that change over time. In
Yampa, a system is defined by a signal function (SF), which determines how the
varying input and the varying output relate.

Code can be written in multiple styles: _applicative style_, _arrowized style_,
and just plain _arrow combinators_. All three are compatible and
interchangeable.

For example, the following signal function takes a value, integrates it, and
then divides that value by the current time:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}
import FRP.Yampa

signalFunction :: SF Double Double
signalFunction = proc x -> do
  y <- integral -< x
  t <- time     -< ()
  returnA -< y / t
```

This signal function says that the output signal is the integral `y` of the
input signal `x`, divided by the time `t`. The elements between `<-` and `-<`
are always signal functions (in this case, `integral` and `time` are signal
functions used to define another signal function).

The example above is written in arrow syntax and uses a Haskell extension
called Arrows. If you are unhappy using arrow syntax, you can implement the
same behavior using applicative style and/or arrow combinators:

```haskell
-- Applicative style
signalFunction1 :: SF Double Double
signalFunction1 = (/) <$> integral <*> time

-- Functional style with arrow combinators
signalFunction2 :: SF Double Double
signalFunction2 = (integral &&& time) >>^ (/)
```

All three are equivalent, and it's a matter of which one you like best.

To run this example, we need to provide the inputs, the times, and consume the
output:
```haskell
firstSample :: IO Double   -- sample at time zero
firstSample =
  return 1.0  -- time == 0, input == 1.0

nextSamples :: Bool -> IO (Double, Maybe Double)
nextSamples _ =
  return (0.1, Just 1.0) -- time delta == 0.1s, input == 1.0

output :: Bool -> Double -> IO Bool
output _ x = do
  print x     -- print the output
  return False -- just continue forever
```

This is a trivial example, since the integral of the constant function 1.0 over
time, divided by the time, is always 1.0! Nevertheless, we are now ready to
run!

```
ghci> reactimate firstSample nextSamples output signalFunction
1.0
1.0
1.0
1.0
1.0
1.0
...
```

There is a directory with examples, which includes two basic SDL examples and
one with using a Nintendo Wii Remote. You can install them with:

```
$ cabal update
$ cabal install Yampa -fexamples
```

Yampa comes with a sophisticated testing library that allows you to use
QuickCheck to test your games, and use a time-travel debugger. These features
are described in the paper [Testing and Debugging Functional Reactive
Programming](http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N46564).

# Contributions
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

Feel free to open new issues. We are looking for:

- New games and applications that use Yampa.
- Libraries that help use Yampa in a particular domain, or apply it to a
  specific platform.
- Papers that mention Yampa.
- Extensions to write programs that are not currently possible or convenient to
  capture.
- Bug fixes.
- Improvements to make the code demonstrably faster or smaller.

If this library helps you, you may want to consider [buying the maintainer a cup of coffee](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=ivanperez-keera&url=https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa&title=Yampa&language=&tags=github&category=software).

## Structure and internals
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

This project is split in two:

- _Yampa_: FRP library.
- _Yampa-test_: a testing layer for Yampa.

Yampa's unit tests are mostly implemented as tests inside the yampa-test
library. The module hierarchy of `yampa-test/tests/Test` mirrors that of Yampa.

A directory `yampa/examples` contains a number of examples of Yampa programs,
some of which can be installed with the flag `-fexamples`.

## Style
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

We follow [this style
guide](https://keera.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/haskellguide-v1.3.0.pdf)
for the Haskell code and [this style
guide](https://keera.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cabalguide-v1.3.0.pdf)
for Cabal files.

## Version control
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

We follow [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
In addition:

- Please document your commits clearly and separately.
- Always refer to the issue you are fixing in the commit summary line with the
  text `Refs #<issue_number>` at the end.
- If there is no issue for your change, then open an issue first and document
  what you are trying to achieve/improve/fix.
- Do not address more than one issue per commit or per PR. If two changes are
  not directly related to one another, they belong in different PRs, issues and
  commits.
- Document what you did in the respective CHANGELOGs in a separate commit
  before you send a PR.
- Make sure your changes conform to the [coding
  style](https://keera.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/haskellguide-v1.3.0.pdf).

See the recent repo history for examples of this process. Using a visual repo
inspection tool like `gitk` may help.

## Versioning model
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

The versioning model we use is the standard in Haskell packages. Versions have
the format `<PUB>.<MAJOR>.<MINOR>(.<PATCH>)?` where:

- `<PUB>` is just a way to signal important milestones or used for promotional
  reasons (to indicate a major advancement). A zero on this position has no
  special meaning.

- `<MAJOR>` increases on incompatible API changes.

- `<MINOR>` increases on backwards-compatible changes.

- `<PATCH>` (optional) increases on small changes that do not affect behavior
  (e.g., documentation).

# History
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

This library was created by Henrik Nilsson and Antony Courtney in 2002, while
working at Yale's Haskell group, led by Paul Hudak. The design and
implementation benefited from frequent discussions with other members of the
group, including also John Peterson. From 2008 to 2012, it was maintained by
George Giorgidze. In 2014, maintenance was passed to Ivan Perez.

Yampa is the longest standing FRP implementation in Haskell still in use. It
has seen and continues to see abundant use in industry, research, and academia.
We invite you to be part of this incredible community project as a user, a
contributor, and overall supporter.

Yampa is named after the Yampa river in Colorado, USA.
